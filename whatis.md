### [License for open source projects: Apache, MIT, GPL](https://exygy.com/which-license-should-i-use-mit-vs-apache-vs-gpl/)

+ The MIT, BSD, and ISC licenses are “permissive licenses”. They are extremely short and essentially say *“do whatever you want with this, just don’t sue me.”*

+ The Apache license says *“do whatever you want with this, just don’t sue me” but does so with many more words, which lawyers like because it adds specificity.* It also contains a patent license and retaliation clause which is designed to prevent patents (including patent trolls) from encumbering the software project.

+ The GPL licenses (GPLv3, GPLv2, LGPL, Affero GPL) all contain some kind of share-alike license. They essentially say *“if you make a derivative work of this, and distribute it to others under certain circumstances, then you have to provide the source code under this license.”* The important thing to know here is that “derivative work” and “certain circumstances” both require some legal analysis to understand the meaning and impact for your project.
